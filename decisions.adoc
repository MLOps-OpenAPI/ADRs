Purpose
-------
Create a record for each significant architectural decision made throughout the course of the engagement.

Hint: "Significant" is subjective, but a good rule of thumb is to create a record for any decision that is not obvious or trivial.

Example
--------
[id=ADR-42,title='The answer to life the universe and everything']
[cols="1h,3a"]
|===
| ID
| ADR-42
| Title
| The answer to life the universe and everything
| Status
| ACCEPTED
| Subject Area(s)
| Life, the Universe, and Everything
| Question
| What is the answer to life the universe and everything?
| Issue or Problem
| The answer to life the universe and everything is not known.
| Assumptions
| The answer to life the universe and everything is knowable.
| Alternatives
| 1. 42
| 2. 43
| 3. 41
| Decision
| 42
| Justification
| The answer to life the universe and everything is 42 per Deep Thought.

[id="decisions_{context}"]
= Decisions
Architectural decisions made throughout the course of the engagement with information on the investigated alternatives and justification for the decisions made.

// copy this template for each decision
// update the ID to equal the ID and the title to equal the title, useful for linking to this section
[id=ADR-001,title='Use GitHub as information/code repository']
[cols="1h,3a"]
|===

| ID
| ADR-001
// A unique code that unambiguously identifies the decision; for example: “ADR-42.”

| Title
| Use GitHub as information/code repository

| Status
| PROPOSED
// Used to provide information about the current state of the decision.
// Possible states include (but are not limited to) the following:
// - PROPOSED: A suggested or newly introduced decision
// - REJECTED: A decision that has been declined or not accepted
// - ACCEPTED: A decision that has been collectively agreed upon
// - DEPRECATED: A decision that may still be used, but has become less relevant or outdated
// - SUPERSEDED BY [ADR-0043](0043-example.md): A decision that has been replaced by a newer, more relevant or effective decision

| Subject Area(s)
| #TODO subject areas, can think of this like hashtags#

| Question
| #TODO State the to-be decision as a question#
//HINT: if something is more of a organizational mandate or standard, such as, "must conform to NIST 800-53", then use an Architectural Policy or Principle instead. But if there is a decision to be made between alternatives for HOW to conform to NIST 800-53 then you would create an ADR.

| Issue or Problem
| #TODO Context for why the architectural question is being asked.#

| Assumptions
| #TODO What is believed to be true about the context of the problem, constraints on the solution, and so on.#

| Alternatives
| #TODO An enumerated list of alternatives and explanations.#
//HINT: if not alternatives were explored then this isn't an architectural decision.

| Decision
| #TODO  The decision taken. This should be one of the named Alternatives; for example: “Alternative 2 is chosen.”#

| Justification
| #TODO Why the decision was made#
//HINT: list the policies or principles that affected the decision.
