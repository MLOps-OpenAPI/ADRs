| Title
| Core-First Schema with Industry-Specific Templates

| Status
| ACCEPTED

| Subject Area(s)
| Schema Design, Extensibility

| Question
| How should we structure the Data Card and Model Card standards to support both general and domain-specific use cases?

| Issue or Problem
| Embedding industry specifics into the core schema hinders reuse, increases maintenance overhead, and causes ripple effects across all consumers.

| Assumptions
| Most consumers need a generic, industry-agnostic schema; regulated domains require additional guardrails; JSON Schema supports referencing and extending definitions as industry-reusable templates.

| Alternatives
| 1. Monolithic, industry-specific schemas (one per domain); 
  2. Core schema with separate templates layered on top;
  3. Core-only schema (no official templates; consumers build their own extensions).

| Decision
| Alternative 2 is chosen: maintain a lean core schema and provide optional, domain-specific templates.

| Justification
| Single source of truth reduces duplication and maintenance effort; templates evolve independently, limiting ripple effects; flexible consumption for general vs specialized domains; aligns with JSON Schema best practices.
